Galleries
=====
This will remove user code on neopets user galleries.

Chrome Extension
-----
If using Chrome or Chromium, the Chrome Extension will work better/faster, removing the user code before the page has loaded.

The .crx file is a pre-packed chrome extension; the source for the extension is in the [galleries/](https://github.com/coreha/neopets/tree/master/galleries/galleries/) directory, and you can use that to pack your own chrome extension.

User Script
-----
The user script should run in Chrome and Firefox. Due to limitations on user scripts, you may see a very brief flash of the user code before it is removed.

Issues
-----
If you encounter any issues, please email/neomail me.
