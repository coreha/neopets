userscripts / browser extensions for neopets

Click on the directories above to see descriptions for individual extensions/scripts.

Purpose
-----
These are all written to address common complaints seen on the neoboards. I've tried to write them to be as concise and easy to understand as possible. 

jQuery
-----
Most extensions include jQuery, in the form of jquery.min.js. (User Scripts share Neopets' copy of jQuery, and so do not need their own.)

jQuery is a large library, and not something you'd be expected to be able to read and understand. It can always be replaced with a copy from [Google's CDN](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js) or a copy directly from [jQuery.com](http://jquery.com).
