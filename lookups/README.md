Lookups
=====
This will remove user code on neopets user lookups.

Chrome Extension
-----
If using Chrome or Chromium, the Chrome Extension will work better/faster, removing the user code before the page has loaded.

The .crx file is a pre-packed chrome extension; the source for the extension is in the [lookups/]:https://github.com/coreha/neopets/tree/master/lookups/lookups directory, and you can use that to pack your own chrome extension.

jquery.min.js can be replaced with a copy from [Google's CDN]:https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js or a copy from [jQuery.com]:http://jquery.com.

User Script
-----
The user script should run in Chrome and Firefox. Due to limitations on user scripts, you may see a very brief flash of the user code before it is removed.


Issues
-----
If you encounter any issues, please email/neomail me.
